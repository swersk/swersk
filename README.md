### Hi there 👋 I'm Lauren! 

📖 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝙼e

I'm a New-York based full stack software engineer. 

I'm passionate about building products and experiences that help people grow through education, mindfulness, and music. 

As a bilingual citizen EU/US and former educator, I build products that celebrate and reflect the beautiful diversity our world offers.
